 STORY:
 Create a paradox, where player is either the one who turns the player or it's his future diciple who turns the player.
 Bits and pieces of story are handed out on stairs that lead to next level. (It's a message from the one who turned directly, in form of dialog
 or a note).
 player is given 5 options of reaction to the dialog, 2 good, 1 neutral, 2 bad.
 
 More will be figured out later.
